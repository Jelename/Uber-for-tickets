# Uber-for-tickets

An app created for browsing, editing and adding events and buying tickets for the same. Every ticket can be added or edited
if user is signed in. Also, every signed in user can post comments for every ticket. 
User can sign up, log in, create new events, tickets or comments.

For every ticket there is an algorithm which is counting percentage of fraud risk. Based on that number, future buyer can 
see how secure that ticket is and can decide which ticket is the best offer.

The app is built with React & Redux on the frontend, and Typescript, Koa, routing-controllers and TypeORM in the backend.
